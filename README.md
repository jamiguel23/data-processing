Lab requirements:

Background: One key task for developers is to collect information from users via forms. For this assignment, we'll create an HTML form that will collect data from a user and process that data upon submission.

Cart with 3 Items:  For this assignment we'll simulate a shopping cart in which the user can select up to one item each of 3 items.  The details of these items, including the cost, images and HTML/CSS to deliver the items to your page can be found in the following repo: Widgets Partial RepoLinks to an external site.

Your form will include checkboxes so a user can select one of each of the items above. Upon submission, the user will get feedback including the names of the items added to the cart, plus the total cost.  This could look something like:

Cart Contents

Widget: $3.99
Sprocket: $5.99
Thingy: $1.99

Total: $11.97

Shipping Information: Your form will include elements to collect the shipping information from the user.  View the required form elements for the Shipping Information section of the form:

First Name - text
Last Name - text
Email - text
Address - text
City - text
State - select
Postal Code -  text
Note - textarea
All of the above elements must be required with the exception of the Note, which is included to allow a user to place a note about the order.

Title Case: Besides processing the total and showing the contents of the shopping cart, you must also change the text of data entered in several of the form elements to title case Links to an external site..  The data for the following form elements must be changed to title case upon submission:

First Name, Last Name, Address, City

You can find code to help you with title case here: Three Ways to Title Case a Sentence in JavaScriptLinks to an external site.

Adding the title case will be done largely by students rather than done together in class.

Identify Purpose: We're going to place this on our Portal, so we need to identify what our page demonstrates as text on the page.  We could use text such as the following:

This page demonstrates data processing of query string data using client side JavaScript.

Upon submission, the cart items are totaled and title case is applied to the Shipping Info.

Created During Class: The work for this assignment was chiefly done together over the course of several classes.  Please view the recordings to see exactly how we did this work.

Submission: Put a link to the working version of your Data Processing web page on your Portal and submit your Portal.
